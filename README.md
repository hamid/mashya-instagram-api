# Examples

_Note for JavaScript users:_
As of Node v.13.5.0, there isn't support for ESModules and the 'import'-syntax.
So you have to read the imports in the examples like this:

`import { A } from 'b'` âž¡ `const { A } = require('b')`

```typescript
import MashyaInstagramBot from 'mashya-instagram-api';


(async () => {

    //-1) Setup individual bot for a acoount
    var bot = new MashyaInstagramBot({
        botName: "myinsta",
        isDevelopment: true,
        logScreenshot:true,  //-** for PRODUCTION enviroments or non GUI os , you should set this options `true`
        log:true,
    });
    await bot.start()
    
    //-2) Login acoount into created bot
    await bot.account.login({
        uname       : "username",
        password    : "pass"
    });

    //-3) and now your bot at your services sir!
    

    //-- Review Home post
     await bot.account.reviewHome({
         postReviewCount     : 10,
         onPostReview        : async (targetPost)=>{
             // console.log('Post Review ...', targetPost);
             await targetPost.comment("Hello... " + targetPost.owner);
         }
     });
     
    //-- load  and follow page
    await bot.page.Follow("meta");


    //-- Comment & like
     let targetPost = await bot.post.loadPostByUrl("https://www.instagram.com/p/CVTtCZotdJX/");
     await targetPost.like();
     await targetPost.comment("Hi friend...");


})();

```

## And ... What's Mashya?

According to persian mythology, Mashya and Mashyana were the first man and woman whose procreation gave rise to the human race based on Zoroastrian cosmology.
Based on Bundahishn, When Ahriman (devil) invaded the world of AhuraMazda, Kiomars were killed by evil spirits.
Kiomars fell into his left hand at his death, and sperm came out of him. The sperm of Kiomars remained on the earth for forty years. And in forty years, with the shape of a one-stemed Rivas-plant, Mashya and Mashyana grew up from the earth. They were so connected together that it was not clear which is the male and which the female. They learned farming, lighting fire, and milking goats from angels.
They did not have sex for fifty years, and sexual desire awoke in them after this time. From them was born in nine month a pair, and owing to tenderness for offspring the mother devoured one, and the father one.
AhuraMazda took this tenderness away, so that one may nourish a child. After that, seven pairs of male and female offspring emerged from them, who are believed to be the human race's ancestors.
